# BloodDonationSystem
The Blood Bank System is designed to manage blood donation and distribution efficiently. The system facilitates blood information collection, storage, and retrieval, ensuring that hospitals and blood banks can track available blood supplies, donor details, and recipient requirements. It aims to streamline the entire blood donation process, making it easier to match donors with recipients in need of life-saving transfusions.
